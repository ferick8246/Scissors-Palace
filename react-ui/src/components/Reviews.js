              Jesse is great! Thoughtful and careful, he doesn’t whip through
              the haircut. Spends time with his clients and will make take time
              making adjustments. No rush, great style, trust him with your
              head!

              I’ve been seeing Ida here for my color for the last few years. No
              matter where I move in the city, I still go to her. The salon is
              friendly and cozy, and who can complain about a glass of wine
              while your color is sitting?

              Go see Celeste! She is fantastic and saved my hair who someone
              else totally ruined. I did not even have to cut it. She is an
              absolute professional and takes care of you 100%. Her color
              correction was totally amazing and I had a great time too.

              Nobody cuts hair like Kevin. Nobody. If he gets any kindler or
              gentler, he's literally going to ceast to exist. I will build a
              great great momument of him and keep all the bad stylists out of
              the country. And they will pay for that monument. Mark my words. I
              have a great relationship with him, as you possibly have heard.
              And he likes me. I like him. People vote for me because I'm so
              good looking and Kevin makes sure of it. I have the best haircut
              to ever come out of a salon, by far. Nobody has a better haircut
              than me. I have the best one. I look very much forward to showing
              my haircut. Nobody writes better reviews than me. I've got a piece
              of pocket-lint worth more than Beyonce's review.
